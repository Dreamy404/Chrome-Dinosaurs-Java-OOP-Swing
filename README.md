## Introduction

This is a project I made to practice OOP in java (Swing Library) in my second semester of university.

## Game Details
It's classic Chrome Dino Game.press UP-ARROW button on your keyboard for jumping over obstacle and DOWN-ARROW for ducking under the flying obstacle.
Also press SPACE button to start a new game once your game is over.


## Acknowledgement
Images are not my property.These are taken from the internet and my first idea of the game was from a youtube tutorial where the project was coded with only simple features. I then added and improved some more features and also re-arranged  the class structures for better code management and User interface flexibility.

## It's free
You are encouraged to use this as a reference to your own project.If you feel like it was helpful,that would be my pleasure.
